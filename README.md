# Introduction

## Problem Statement
When it comes to digital transactions, fraud has become an increasingly serious issue. With online payments on the rise, both consumers and financial institutions face significant risks from fraudulent activities. 

This project aims to tackle this challenge head-on by developing a machine learning model designed to detect fraudulent transactions effectively. The innovative twist? Weâ€™re using synthetic data generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance our model's training process. This approach not only improves the model's accuracy but also ensures it can adapt to a wide range of fraud scenarios.

## Objective
The key objective is to design a fraud detection model that leverages advanced machine learning techniques, including GANs for data augmentation, to improve detection accuracy. This involves implementing a robust pipeline for model development, training, and deployment, incorporating continuous tracking and version control of models and experiments through MLflow.

# Methodology

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python & Jupyter Notebooks**: Used for developing and running the project code, leveraging the extensive ecosystem of data science libraries.
- **MLflow**: Employed for managing and tracking experiments, facilitating model versioning, and ensuring reproducibility.
- **XGBoost, RandomForest, LightGBM**: Utilized for their efficiency in handling imbalanced datasets and high-dimensional data, crucial for fraud detection tasks.
- **PyTorch**: Used to build GANs for generating synthetic transaction data.
- **Category Encoders & Scikit-learn**: Used for data preprocessing, including encoding categorical variables and standardizing numerical features.
- **Pyngrok**: Deployed to create a secure tunnel to host the MLflow UI, enabling remote access for tracking experiments.

## Approach

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Data Loading and Initial Cleaning**: 
    - Data was sourced from Kaggle, split into training and testing sets, and concatenated for comprehensive analysis.
    - Missing values were imputed, and unnecessary columns were dropped to maintain a clean dataset.

- **Feature Engineering**:
    - Advanced feature engineering included extracting time-based features (e.g., hour of transaction), calculating age from date of birth, and measuring geographical displacement between customer and merchant locations.
    - These features were categorized into bins to enhance model interpretability and performance.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Data visualization techniques were employed to understand the distribution of transaction amounts and identify potential outliers.
    - A box plot of transaction amounts highlighted the quartiles, crucial for understanding typical transaction ranges and identifying anomalies.

### 2. Model Training and Evaluation
- **Model Selection and Tuning**:
    - Various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and LightGBM, were evaluated.
    - Models were fitted using a pipeline approach that integrates preprocessing steps, ensuring data consistency throughout the training process.

- **Experiment Tracking with MLflow**:
    - Each model's performance was tracked using MLflow, logging parameters, metrics, and model versions.
    - This setup ensured systematic experimentation and allowed for easy comparisons between models.

- **Feature Importance Analysis**:
    - Random Forest was used to assess feature importance, revealing that transaction amount, category, job, state, and displacement were significant predictors of fraud. These insights guided further model refinement.

### 3. Data Augmentation with GANs
- **GAN Implementation**:
    - A TCGAN was constructed with a generator and discriminator network to produce realistic synthetic transaction data.
    - The generator creates fake samples while the discriminator evaluates their authenticity. This iterative process enhances the generator's ability to create indistinguishable synthetic data from real transactions.

- **Conditional Tabular GAN**:
    - Specifically designed for generating synthetic tabular data, introducing key innovations:
        - **Conditional Generation**: By conditioning the generation process on specific categories, CTGAN better handles categorical variables and their imbalances.
        - **Mode-Specific Normalization**: The model learns multimodal distributions, common in real-world datasets.
        - **Training Strategy**: CTGAN uses a specialized training-by-sampling approach to address imbalanced discrete columns and improve stability and quality of generated data.

- **Model Implementation**:
    - The CTGAN model was implemented based on the *Modeling Tabular Data Using Conditional GAN* paper presented at the 2019 NeurIPS conference.
    - Features included:
        - Fully-connected networks
        - Gumbel softmax
        - Leaky ReLU activations
        - Linear transformation
        - Batch normalization and dropout
        - Wasserstein GAN loss with gradient penalty
        - Adam optimizer

- **Training Process**:
    - The GAN training involves optimizing both networks to minimize the discriminator's ability to distinguish between real and synthetic data while maximizing the generator's ability to create convincing samples.
    - Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs were tuned for optimal performance.

### 4. Deployment and Monitoring
- **MLOps Integration**:
    - MLflow and Pyngrok were used to deploy the model and provide a user-friendly interface for experiment tracking. This setup facilitates continuous monitoring and rapid iteration of model versions as new data becomes available.

- **Streamlit**:
    - The final XGBoost model was deployed on Streamlit to create intuitive, interactive web applications that enhance user engagement with models.

- **Hugging Face and Gradio**:
    - Hugging Face Spaces combined with Gradio simplifies model deployment, making it accessible for non-technical users.

# Challenges

## Difficulties Faced
- Ensuring the quality of synthetic data generated by GANs was a significant challenge. The TCGAN needed fine-tuning regarding the suitable number of training epochs to balance the discriminator and generator's learning pace effectively.
- Managing the volume of training data and computational demands of training GANs.

## How They Were Overcome
- Iterative tuning of the GAN architecture, including layer configurations and learning rates, was conducted to produce high-quality synthetic data. Leveraging the innovative architecture of TCGAN from the literature helped approach the correct model.
